Classify images of handwritten digits with a LeNet Convolutional Neural Network and a Deep Neural Network

This repository contains 2 Python files that both:

* Import images of handwritten digits from MNIST

* Train a neural network using KERAS to classify the images

The difference is that `Convolutional_Neural_Network.ipynb` uses convolutional neural networks to train the model. `mnist_deep_learning.py` uses a Deep Neural Network to achieve the same goal, but has a lower accuracy on test data.

You can run `Convolutional_Neural_Network.ipynb` on Google Colab. It is best to press `Runtime`> `Change runtime type` > `Hardware Accelerator` > `GPU` to improve the runtime signficantly.
